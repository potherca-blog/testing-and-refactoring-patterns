# Patterns for testing

This repository contains examples of how specific scenarios in the code can be tested, or how they could be refactored in order to make them easier to test.

The main idea is that as little of the code should be changed a possible, so adding tests remains cheap.

Once tests for code have been created, the code-under-test could also be refactored.
